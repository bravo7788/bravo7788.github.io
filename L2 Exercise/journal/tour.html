        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li> Walla Walla</li>
            <li>WA Magic City</li>
            <li> ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful</li>
            <li>UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance</li>
            <li> CO</li>
            <br> Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p class="b"> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>Passing cars,
            <br> When you can't see,
            <br> May get you,
            <br> A glimpse,
            <br> Of eternity.
            <br>
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li> iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li> and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="d">
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q> A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
